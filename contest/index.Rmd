<h1>Welcome to the CovidR Contest!</h1>


[**eRum2020::CovidR**](about.html) is an open-source contest and pre-conference event launched by the 2020 European R Users Meeting ([**e-Rum2020**](https://2020.erum.io/)), featuring any work done with R around the topic of the [**COVID-19 pandemic**](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

The pre-conference virtual event will take place on **May 29th**, when selected participants will be invited to present their work and the contest winners will be announced and awarded with e-prizes. Accepted contributions ([submitted](submit.html) before May 22nd) are made available in this website, where the wider community is invited to provide feedback. The winner(s) will be announced during the conference pre-event on **May 29th**. Attendance to the event is subject to a [**free registration**](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/covidr-erum-2020-pre-conference-event-tickets-104133026686), closing on **May 22nd**.

The set of **accepted submissions** feature the contributions below. The corresponding gallery pages allow the wider community to browse through and **like contributions**.

# Create the list of contributions
# NOTE: We want to allow voting contributions directly from the list, however we
# cannot have one modal per contribution since utteranc.es seems to struggle
# when retrieving multiple issues simultaneously. As a workaround, we have only
# one modal that we update with page-specific utterances and content on click.
