author: Tim Churches
abstract: |
  A series of blog posts starting on 18th February 2020 demonstrating the use of R to obtain,
  analyse and visualise COVID-19 data, including scraping of detailed data from wikipedia, the
  calculation of the time-variant effective reproduction number $R_{t}$, which has subquentially become widely adopted
  as a measure of COVID-19 intervention success, and the creation of both dynamic and stochastic
  individual contact models to simulate COVID-19 spread and investigate the likely effects of various
  public health interventions in a population.
