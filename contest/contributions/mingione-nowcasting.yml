  Our work is intended to give people an easy tool for accessing information
  about the Italian COVID-19 epidemic in an interactive and transparent way.
  The web application we built is automatically updated every day after the Italian Protezione Civile report ([Data Source](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19))
  and shows both descriptive and modeling analysis, giving the user the possibility to customize several choices.
