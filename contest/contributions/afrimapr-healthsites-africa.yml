  An app and R package to improve access to the best-available health facility data for Africa
  to support the response to the pandemic. There are two main Africa-wide sources of open data
  on the locations of > 100k hospitals and health facilities.
  Neither is perfect and there is variable overlap between them.
  This app allows detailed comparison of the datasets to inform pandemic response
  and allow improvement. Users can select from 52 countries, view zoomable maps of locations,
  see summaries by facility type and view the raw data.
  The R package has functions to make similar comparisons for data obtained from country-specific
  sources. Part of the afrimapr project, creating R building-blocks to ease use of open health
  data in Africa.
