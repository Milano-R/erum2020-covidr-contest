abstract: |
  COVID-19 Canada Data Explorer is an interactive Shiny app to break down and analyze
  the official COVID-19 dataset available from the Government of Canada
  (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/src/data/covidLive/covid19.csv).
  The app can be used to visualize 13 different indicators by time and geography, and
  to directly compare the epidemiological situation across Canada's provinces and
  territories. It also allows users to custom-build and download their own datasets.
