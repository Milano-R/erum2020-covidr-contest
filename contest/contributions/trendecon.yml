abstract: |
  During the Covid-19 pandemic, information and the (economic and social)
  situation has changed rapidly. Traditional (economic) indicators are not
  sufficiently frequent to monitor and forecast (economic and social) activity
  at high frequency. We use Google search trends to overcome this data gap and
  create meaningful indicators. We extract daily search data on keywords
  reflecting consumers' perception of the economic situation. The indicators
  are available at [www.trendecon.org](https://www.trendecon.org).

  An accompaning R package contains the code to construct long daily time series
  from Google Trends. Robustness of the data is achieved by querying Google
  mulitple times. The queries are sampled at daily, weekly and monthy
  frequencies and then harmonized such that the long term trend is preserved. A
  more detailed methodological description is given on the
  [website](https://www.trendecon.org/#method). We are currently summarizing
  these results in a research paper.
