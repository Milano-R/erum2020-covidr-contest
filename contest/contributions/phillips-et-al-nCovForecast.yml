  Motivated by genuine concern that many countries were being caught flat-footed by the coronavirus pandemic, 
  we built a shiny app that gives a simple ten-day projection of case numbers under current growth rates, for every country.  
  The site also provides key metrics of growth, and case detection, and provides state-level analyses for some countries. 
  The idea was to move us past the paralysis of daily shock and towards important action, 
  but the site also gives us feedback on how our actions are working. 
  The data are updated daily, and come from datasets collated by John Hopkins University and the Indian government.
