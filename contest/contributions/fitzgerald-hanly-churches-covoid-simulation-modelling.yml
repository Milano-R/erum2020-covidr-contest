title: "COVOID: Modelling COVID-19 Transmission and Interventions"
author: Oisin Fitzgerald, Mark Hanly, Tim Churches (UNSW Medicine)
abstract: |
  COVOID is an evolving but fully-functional R package and accompanying Shiny app
  for simulation modelling of both COVID-19 transmission and the interventions 
  intended to reduce that transmission, using deterministic compartmental models
  (DCMs). The built-in Shiny app enables ease of use and demonstration of key
  concepts to those without R programming backgrounds. The package contains an
  expanding API for simulating and estimating homogeneous and age-structured
  SIR, SEIR and extended models. In particular COVOID allows the simultaneous
  simulation of age specific (e.g. school closures) and general interventions
  over varying time intervals. This is informed through incorporation of
  publicly available data on population demographics from the United Nations,
  age and setting specific contact rates from previously published research and
  COVID-19 incidence counts from the European CDC. Technical background
  documentation and vignettes are provided, illustrating the use of the package,
  including the extended model. Work is ongoing to add the ability to model
  imported cases, enhancing parameter fitting to observed data, and to expand
  the Shiny UI to address the extended model and to manage parameter sensitivity
  analyses and comparisons of intervention scenario.
