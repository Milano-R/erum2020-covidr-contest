abstract: |
  Myriad of data is generated every minute from everywhere, and in different formats offering the consumers a large availability of information . However,  the reliability of this information differ highly across sources. 
  Unreliable sources provide misleading and biased information, which might lead to dangerous consequences especially in the case of epidemics, like covid-19 in which falsehoods are a matter of life-and death. 
  Users find it difficult to manually check all information, therefore,  in this project we propose a question answering tool that can automatically answers the user using a pre-trained model based on reliable data sources.
