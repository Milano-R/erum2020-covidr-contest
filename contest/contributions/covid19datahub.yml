  Built with R, available in any language, the Hub provides a worldwide, fine-grained, unified dataset helpful for a better understanding of COVID-19.
  The user can instantly download up-to-date, structured, historical daily data across several official sources. The data are hourly crunched by the R package COVID19 and made available in csv format on a cloud storage, so to be easily accessible from Excel, R, Python... and any other software.  
  We welcome external contributors to join and extend the number of supporting data sources. All sources are properly documented, along with their citation.  
  COVID-19 Data Hub can spot misalignments between data-sources and automatically inform authorities of possible errors. All logs are available at https://covid19datahub.io  
  Available on CRAN.
