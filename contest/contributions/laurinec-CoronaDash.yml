title: CoronaDash - clustering-analytical tool for comparing countries' COVID-19 trends
author: Peter Laurinec
abstract: |
  The CoronaDash is an interactive dashboard that provides advanced time series data mining tools for comparing countries' trends for any derived statistic(s) with the option of user parameter tuning.
  For example, comparing countries with "since first" trajectories graphs, clustering these trajectories/multiple statistics with hierarchical clustering, and showing these results with various graphs such as dendrograms, a grid of clusters members, and MDS 2D similarity checks.
  It also covers and shows various statistics (many derived from the original ones) for every country, and extrapolate cases with exponential smoothing.
  The data (updated daily) are coming from GitHub repositories of CSSEGISandData, ulklc, and ChrisMichaelPerezSantiago using official data sources.
