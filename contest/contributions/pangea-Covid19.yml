It is divided in 4 sections  in Previsioni we show short term forecasts for the total counts of infected people and deaths obtained with 3 different statistical models;  in Terapia Intensiva we show the occupation of intensive care units by covid19 patients on a regional basis;  in Per Regione/Per Provincia we show the trend several variables (new cases, deaths, swabs, number of tested people) on a regional basis allowing a comparison between regions;  in Matematica della diffusione we explain why we use different forecasting models.  Data are provided by Protezione Civile, ISTAT and Ministero della Salute.
