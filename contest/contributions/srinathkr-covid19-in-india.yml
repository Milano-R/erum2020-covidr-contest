abstract: |
  COVID-19 in India : An Analysis is a dashboard/tracker made to understand the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic across India, in terms of confirmed, active, recovered and death cases, both overall and state-wise with the help of plots and map. This application has been made entirely using Rmarkdown framework. 
  The data source is COVID-19 India API, a volunteer-driven API for COVID-19 stats in India which collects data from official press bulletins, reports released by various states in India and from official Twitter handles of various state Chief Ministers and Health Ministers. 
  This project provides a summary of all types of cases reported, for the entire country in total and for each state; provides state-wise analysis with the help of a plot and a map and provides both cumulative and daily trends in cases in the country. 
  The main feature of this project is the SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model. This model has been applied for India for a period of 150 days starting from March 1, 2020. 
  With the help of this model, an important epidemiological parameter known as R0 (Basic Reproduction Number) is calculated.
