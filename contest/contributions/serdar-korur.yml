  Important Note >> The app uses Google firebase authentication to work.
  Thus, only authenticated users are able to interact with the app. ([More info and a Demo on youTube.](https://github.com/korur/cRew#readme))

  Covid-19 pandemic caught us off-guard. To avoid this happening again we probably need tools
  that enable us to react quickly when a new disease emerges and set measures to minimize its spread.
  In an attempt in this direction, we developed cRew.

  coRanavirus early-warning (cRew) tracks Covid-19 / flu like disease symptoms in real-time.
  The goal is to map in real-time healthy and symptomatic people. As users enter data about
  their health status, the app monitors temporal and spatial changes and estimates sudden
  increases or decreases on local risks.
  The app is built with shinyMobile & firebase, echarts4r and fireData packages.
