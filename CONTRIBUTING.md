### How to submit

You can submit your contribution **until May 22nd** using one of the following methods

1. **Pull Request**
    - [**Fork the repository**](https://github.com/Milano-R/erum2020-covidr-contest/fork) and create a **new `.yml` file** under [`contest/contributions`](https://github.com/Milano-R/erum2020-covidr-contest/tree/master/contest/contributions), containing the information above for your contribution.
        - The example above is available as [`.example.yml`](https://github.com/Milano-R/erum2020-covidr-contest/tree/master/contest/contributions/.example.yml) and can be used as a starting point.
        - The file-name should somehow identify your contribution, we recommend using something like `name-short-title.yml`.
    - Create a **Pull Request**, making sure you "Allow edits from maintainers".
    - Send us an email at [covidrcontest@erum.io](mailto:covidrcontest@erum.io) with the link to the Pull Request.
    - You can also preview the integration of your contribution in the [CovidR Gallery](https://milano-r.github.io/erum2020-covidr-contest) from a local clone of your fork via
      - `remotes::install_deps()`
      - `browseURL(file.path("contest", rmarkdown::render_site("contest")))`

2. **Create an Issue**
    - [**Submit the contribution as new Issue**](https://github.com/Milano-R/erum2020-covidr-contest/issues/new/choose) to provide the required information.
    - We will follow up by creating the relevant `.yml` file and corresponding pull request.
    - Send us an email at [covidrcontest@erum.io](mailto:covidrcontest@erum.io) with the link to the Issue.

Your submission will be officially accepted once the corresponding Pull Request is reviewed, approved, and merged. Your contribution will then appear in the [CovidR Gallery](https://milano-r.github.io/erum2020-covidr-contest).
