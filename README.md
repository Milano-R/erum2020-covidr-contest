# eRum2020 CovidR Contest

**CovidR** is an [e-Rum2020](https://2020.erum.io/) **pre-conference

Contributions can be submitted **until May 22nd**, and the online
e-Rum2020 pre-conference event will be held on **May 29th**. Selected
contributors will be invited to present their work to the community at
the event, where the CovidR contest winner(s) will be announced and will
receive their e-prizes. Finally, the best overall contribution will also

    census, geographic distributions, movements, …).

Request submission mechanism](#submit-a-contribution) as a channel for
discussing how you can submit your contribution.
