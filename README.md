# e-Rum2020 CovidR Contest

**CovidR** is an [e-Rum2020 **pre-conference
event**](https://2020.erum.io/covidr-contest/) featuring a contest of R
contributions around the topic of the [COVID-19
pandemic](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

Contributions can be submitted **until May 22nd**, and the online
e-Rum2020 pre-conference event will be held online on **May 29th**.
Selected contributors will be invited to present their work to the
community at the event, where the CovidR contest winner(s) will be
announced and will receive their e-prizes. Finally, the best overall
contribution will also be invited to present at the main e-Rum2020
conference (June 17th-20th).

Attendance to the event is for free, and [**tickets are
available**](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/covidr-erum-2020-pre-conference-event-tickets-104133026686)
until **May 22nd**. Additional information on how to access the event
will be provided to all ticket holders closer to the event.

### Philosophy

***The contest in the right context*** — Due to the relevance of the
topic, we would like to clarify some points so that both the
participants and their audience correctly engage with the CovidR
contest.

The COVID-19 data assets made available by authoritative institutions
are immensely useful. However, their incompleteness and differences in
collection policies may open up to misunderstanding and
miscommunication. Data scientists should force themselves to be
responsible data narrators and communicators. To what extent can Rstats
be a tool for data narrative? Can we use our tools to uncover missing
data and data wrong-doing? A beautiful visualization is not necessarily
about beautiful data, but it’s beautiful when it allows people to
understand what we know as well as (more often) what we actually do not.

The CovidR contest is mostly about R analytics technicalities and for
data geeks, but it’s open to data scientists, analysts, academics and
researchers that may use the single simplest R function, but just on the
right question, at the right time, tackling the many doubts cast by this
so vast paradigmatic change we’re all living. Being original in the
contest means being able to address different aspects of the pandemic.
The CovidR contest is looking for such excellence and originality and we
will also judge how R analytics can be an efficient and valid technical
service to this effort and in such a context.

### How to participate

  - Provide us with your contribution by May 22nd using the GitHub
    repository, following the instructions in the
    [‘Submit’](#submit-a-contribution) section.
  - A GitHub account is needed in order to submit a contribution.

### What you will get

  - All contributions will be featured in the [CovidR
    Gallery](https://milano-r.github.io/erum2020-covidr-contest)
    website, allowing the community to browse through and vote for your
    contribution.
  - Each participant will get a CovidR badge to include in their
    repository.
  - We will share contributions on our social media.
  - Selected contributions will be presented at the e-Rum2020
    pre-conference event on May 29th.
  - Winner(s) will be awarded with e-prizes.
  - The ultimate contest winner will be invited to present at
    [e-Rum2020](https://2020.erum.io/).

### How to win

An internal jury will pick the winner(s) by evaluating:

  - technical quality of the work – i.e. interesting, innovative and
    best-practice usage of the R language;
  - popularity of the work among the community – based on thumbs up in
    the CovidR Gallery.

The winner(s) will be announced during the pre-conference event on May
29th.

### Participation rules

  - Any work or analysis must be performed starting from official data
    (governmental, institutional, national or international), providing
    complete reference to sources.
  - Data used can directly refer to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (official
    number of cases, tests performed, viral genome sequences, …) or to
    different metrics that can affect the course of the infection if put
    in the context of the outbreak (demography, population density,
    census, geographic distributions, movements, …).
  - Work can refer to a single specific country, a group of countries or
    the whole globe.
  - Work or analyses must wholly or at least for a relevant part rely on
    R-based analytics.
  - Data and source code must be open sourced and available through an
    open repository.
  - Work can be of any kind, from original data analyses, models, to
    interactive dashboards or infographics.

If you have general questions you can always contact us at
<covidrcontest@erum.io>, otherwise we recommend using the [Issue / Pull
Request submission mechanism](#submit-a-contribution) as a channel for
discussing how you can submit your contribution.

        from a local clone of your fork via
          - `remotes::install_deps()`
          - `browseURL(file.path("contest",
            rmarkdown::render_site("contest")))`
2.  **Create an Issue**
      - [**Submit the contribution as new
        Issue**](https://github.com/Milano-R/erum2020-covidr-contest/issues/new/choose)
